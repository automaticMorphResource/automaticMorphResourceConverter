How to use:

After building tokennizer,you can use the tokenizer as follows:

1-Run:

    Run tokenizer from command prompt as with following command
    $sh tokenizer_run.sh  tests/tokenizer.rin 
    where tokenizer.rin is the text input file which need to be tokenized

2) Output:

    2.1) The output can be get through standard output if above run command is done as follows
    $sh tokenizer.sh  tests/tokenizer.rin

    2.2) The output can be get in a  file if above run command is done as follows
    $sh tokenizer.sh  tests/tokenizer.rin > tokenizer.rout
